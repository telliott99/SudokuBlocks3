I am trying to recall how I made the icons for my Sudoku app.

I started by making a prototype:  sudoku.png.  I did it by modifying the code so that it would only draw a square if it was filled.  Then I loaded a puzzle that looked nice and took a screenshot.

To get the different sizes I remember using a Swift script.  I think I used images.swift, so I am working through how to bring that up to Swift 3.  For the 2x images, I just used the next size, which I don't think is correct, but it worked.

Then I tried
iconutil -c icns Sudoku.iconset

and as the old notes say
dragging it into the project assets in AppIcon didn't work
I dragged the files individually, and that did work.

It's tricking to bring up the right "area" to drop the files in.  Select xcassets in the Project folder, then the Icons thingie in the middle.

Drag the individual files onto the palette.
Build and run.  Works.


To get a copy of the app.  Run and then do 
Show in Finder on the .app in the Project navigator.

It is a debug build.
Have to find out how to build for release.
