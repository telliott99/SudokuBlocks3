Apple's Retina Displays have
220 Macbook Pro 3rd gen, to
401 iPhone 6 Plus

All of the different displays use
icons at different sizes (esp iOS)

Also, on OS X there are
Desktop app icon
toolbar icon
document icon
Launchpad
App store

All icons are square, the sizes needed are:
1024 x 1024
512x512 @2x (canvas size 1024 x 1024)
512 x 512
256 x 256 @2x
256 x 256
128 x 128 @2x
128 x 128
32 x 32 @2x
32 x 32
16 x 16 @2x
16 x 16

Naming:  iconfiles should be named like
icon_512x512.png
icon_512x512@.png

Put them in a folder:  Sudoku.iconset

iconutil can do the conversion to an icns file
iconutil -c icns Sudoku.iconset

However, dragging it into the project assets in AppIcon didn't work
I dragged the files individually, and that did work.
