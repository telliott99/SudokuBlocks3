I don't remember any more how I made the scaled icons.
I must have notes but I can't find them.
Vaguely remember doing it with Swift image script.

Anyhow, old notes say that dragging .icns file to project didn't work.
In the Project view, click on xcassets.
then in the center click on Appicon.

drag the individual files onto the palette.
Build and run.  Works.


To get a copy of the app.  Run and then do 
show in finder on the .app in the Project navigator.

It is a debug build.
Have to find out how to build for release.
